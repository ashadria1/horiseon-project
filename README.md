Title:
    Code Refactor- Accessibility

Description:  
    This project is an example of a Code Refactor, particularly as it relates to “accessibility.”  A hypothetical marketing agency would like a codebase that conforms to accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines.  Specifically, they request:

    1.	When the source code is viewed, semantic HTML elements are present.
    2.	When the structure of the HTML elements is viewed, the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
    3.	When the image elements are viewed, accessible alt attributes are found.
    4.	When the heading attributes are viewed, they fall in sequential order.
    5.	When the title element is viewed, a concise, descriptive title is found.


The motivation for this project is to meet the challenges of a would-be employer and their functional/technical requirements.  I'm still learning about semantic html, so this is a great opportunity to flex those chops.
